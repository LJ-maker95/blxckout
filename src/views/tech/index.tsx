Solana is the fastest blockchain in the world and the fastest growing ecosystem in crypto, with thousands of projects spanning DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and more.Integrate once and never worry about scaling again. Solana ensures composability between ecosystem projects by maintaining a single global state as the network scales.</p>
        <p className="text-center py-5 px-20">Never deal with fragmented Layer 2 systems or sharded chains. Solana's scalability ensures transactions remain less than $0.01 for both developers and users.Solana is all about speed, with 400 millisecond block times. And as hardware gets faster, so does the network. Not only is Solana ultra-fast and low cost, it is censorship resistant. Meaning, the network will remain open for applications to run freely and transactions will never be stopped. </p>
